Notes on quality checks:
- No missing values detected (no consecutive commas found).
- Values are in a plausible clinical range for simulated EEG-derived features (tens to low hundreds).

4) How to interpret the labels
- health_status:
  • healthy: Baseline/normal EEG patterns predominately.
  • unhealthy: EEG patterns consistent with neurological conditions.
- disease (for unhealthy only):
  • parkinson, brain_tumor, brain_stroke, alzheimer, epilepsy, migraine.
- mood: 
  • happy, neutral, sad — interpreted as affective state proxies derived from EEG patterns.

5) Preprocessing pipeline (what was done to the data)
- Basic feature engineering: ‘eeg_mean’ computed as the average across eeg_1..eeg_14 (see scripts/calculate_mean.py).
- Encodings: Label encoders were applied in downstream scripts to create numeric targets/features, e.g., mood_encoded, health_encoded, disease_encoded.
- Model-ready datasets: mood_data.csv, health_data.csv, and disease_data.csv/disease_data_lstm.csv add predictions and encodings generated by the respective models.

6) Intended multi-source provenance (treating this as a real-world aggregation)
In a real data acquisition setting for this experiment, we would aggregate EEG and labels from multiple reputable public repositories and hospital partners. Below are representative sources, with links and reported sizes as per their official pages. These sources cover healthy controls, motor/imagery tasks, emotion/mood signals, and clinical pathologies such as epilepsy and general abnormalities.

A) PhysioNet: EEG Motor Movement/Imagery (MMI)
- URL: https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/
- Size: “over 1500 one- and two-minute EEG recordings” from 109 volunteers; 64-channel EEG at 160 Hz.
- Why used: Provides diverse, labeled EEG tasks (rest, motor execution, motor imagery) suitable for baseline and control patterns and method development.

B) PhysioNet: CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database (Pediatric Epilepsy)
- URL: https://physionet.org/content/chbmit/1.0.0/
- Size: 22 pediatric subjects grouped into 23–24 cases; 664 EDF files total; 198 recorded seizures annotated; 23–26 channels at 256 Hz.
- Why used: High-quality seizure/epilepsy data for clinical pathology modeling and evaluation.

C) TUH EEG Corpus (Temple University Hospital)
- URL (overview/landing): https://isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/
- Scale (per TUH/NEDC): over 60,000 EEGs currently available; early releases >20,000 EEGs, growing by ~1,000 per year; 24–36 channels at ~250 Hz; includes associated EEG reports.
- Why used: Broad coverage of normal/abnormal clinical EEGs across many diagnoses. Suitable for general abnormality detection and disease cohorts (e.g., tumor, stroke indicators as abnormal EEG subgroups curated via reports).

D) DEAP: Emotion Analysis using EEG, Physiological, and Video Signals
- URL: http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/
- Size: 32 participants; 40 one-minute trials per participant; multimodal signals including 32-channel EEG.
- Why used: Standard benchmark for affective state analysis; informs mood label modeling and validation.

E) Additional healthy-control baselines and motor/imagery tasks
- The MMI dataset (A) includes baseline runs (eyes open/closed) for controls.
- Other public resources (e.g., TUH normal/abnormal splits) can supply healthy control EEGs at scale.

F) OpenNeuro: BIDS-Compliant EEG Collections (many datasets)
- URL (EEG modality): https://openneuro.org/search/modality/eeg
- Overview: https://openneuro.org/
- Scale (as listed on homepage, accessed 2025-01-28): EEG category shows ~17,322 participants across ~347 public datasets. All datasets are organized using the BIDS standard and most include DOIs/snapshots for reproducibility. Data are downloadable directly or via DataLad.
- Why used: Broad, well-curated, reproducible EEG collections spanning tasks (ERP, resting-state, cognitive paradigms) and diverse populations; ideal for augmenting healthy controls, task-based EEG, and method benchmarking.

G) Kaggle EEG Sources (competition-curated datasets)
- American Epilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge (EEG):
  https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/seizure-prediction
  Focus: seizure onset prediction from EEG time series; widely used in epilepsy research benchmarking (Kaggle account required).
- Grasp-and-Lift EEG Detection:
  https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/grasp-and-lift-eeg-detection/overview
  Focus: event detection for motor tasks using EEG signals (Kaggle account required).
- Why used: Competition datasets provide standardized splits/benchmarks, facilitating fair comparison for seizure detection and motor-related EEG modeling.

Mapping to our study’s label needs:
- Healthy controls: MMI baselines, TUH normal EEGs.
- Epilepsy cohort: CHB-MIT, TUH seizure subsets.
- General abnormalities (e.g., stroke/tumor/Alzheimer-like EEG changes): TUH clinical cohorts using report-derived labels.
- Mood/affect cues: DEAP (and similar affective EEG corpora) as methodological reference for feature engineering and validation.

7) Quantity used in this study (study dataset of 1,000 rows)
- Source composition (study-level):
  • Total encounters: 1,000 (rows in raw_data.csv)
  • Healthy: 311
  • Unhealthy: 689
  • Disease breakdown within Unhealthy (counts):
    - epilepsy:      140
    - parkinson:     125
    - brain_stroke:  121
    - brain_tumor:   115
    - migraine:       95
    - alzheimer:      93
  • Mood distribution (all encounters):
    - sad:     577
    - happy:   306
    - neutral: 117

Note: The per-disease counts above indicate relative representation for modeling difficulty and class balance; epilepsy is the largest group here, while Alzheimer’s and migraine are smaller, reflecting realistic imbalance scenarios in clinical datasets.

8) How we would harmonize real multi-source data
- File formats: Convert EDF/EDF+ to a unified pipeline (WFDB/NumPy/Pandas) with consistent channel naming/montage.
- Sampling rates: Resample to a common frequency; apply filters (e.g., bandpass, notch) consistently.
- Channel sets: Map 64/32/23-channel sources to a consistent low-density 14-channel feature space (e.g., via spatial filtering, channel selection, or learned projections).
- Labels: Normalize labeling schemes across sources (e.g., ICD codes, clinical notes) into our target taxonomy (healthy/unhealthy; disease classes; mood/affect where applicable).
- QA: Remove corrupted segments, handle artifacts (EOG/EMG), and document exclusion criteria.

9) Governance, privacy, and ethics (for real acquisitions)
- Data use agreements (DUAs) and IRB approvals would govern access, storage, and use.
- All PHI would be removed or de-identified; only research-grade signals and derived labels retained.
- Attribution: Follow each source’s license and citation requirements (see links above).

10) Limitations and notes
- The schema here uses 14 anonymized EEG channels (eeg_1..eeg_14) to keep modeling simple and uniform. Real sources often provide 23–64 channels; harmonization is required.
- Mood labels from EEG remain an active research area; we use them as affective proxies to enrich multi-task learning.
- Class imbalance is present (e.g., epilepsy larger than Alzheimer’s/migraine). Metrics should be macro-averaged, with class weights or resampling in training.

Provenance note for this repository
- The CSVs in this codebase were programmatically generated to emulate the data distributions and schema described above so that the end-to-end pipeline can be executed locally without restricted-access data.
- The public links listed in Section 6 are representative sources we would use to build a comparable real-world dataset, and their reported sizes are quoted from the official pages at the time of writing.
